'Ternary' is an R package that allows the creation of ternary plots 
(a.k.a. ternary graphs / simplex plots / Gibbs triangles / de Finetti diagrams) 
using the familiar functions of the default 'graphics' package.

For simple use cases, generate ternary plots using the point-and-click
Shiny app:

```
install.packages('Ternary')
Ternary::TernaryApp()
```

For greater control over your plots, use the R command line;
usage instructions can be 
[viewed here](https://ms609.github.io/Ternary/articles/Ternary.html).

Please let me know of any feature requests or bugs by [opening an
